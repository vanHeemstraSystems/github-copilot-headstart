# GitHub Copilot - Headstart

Based on "GitHub Copilot" at https://copilot.github.com/

Get code suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.

Write a comment describing the logic you want and GitHub Copilot will immediately suggest code to implement the solution.

GitHub Copilot integrates directly into your editor including Neovim, JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code—and is fast enough to use as you type.

GitHub Copilot works best when you divide your code into small functions, use meaningful names for functions parameters, and write good docstrings and comments as you go. It also seems to do best when it’s helping you navigate unfamiliar libraries or frameworks.

Let's try and write an application based on best practices (in JavaScript) and see how well GitHub Copilot assists us.
